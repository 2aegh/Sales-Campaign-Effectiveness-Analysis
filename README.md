# Sales Campaign Effectiveness Analysis

## Introduction

This project involves analyzing the effectiveness of a sales incentive campaign conducted by an organization. The campaign aimed to increase sales performance among agents by offering rewards upon achieving specific sales targets. An A/B testing approach was utilized to evaluate different incentive structures and their impact on sales and profitability.

## Campaign Overview

- **Group A**: Received a target and a reward. If agents met the target, they received the reward. Selling less than the target resulted in no reward, and exceeding the target did not yield additional rewards.
- **Group B**: Also received a target and a different reward structure from Group A. The same rules applied regarding reward eligibility.
- **Group C**: Control group with no targets or rewards.

## Data Description

- **Product Profit**: The profit earned from selling goods, excluding any rewards given to agents.
- **Number of Finished Products**: The number of items sold by agents.

## Objectives

- Define Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to evaluate the effectiveness of the sales campaigns.
- Analyze and compare the performance of Groups A and B against the control group (Group C).
- Determine which, if any, of the incentive structures were successful.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The following KPIs were defined to assess the campaign:

1. **Target Achievement Rate (TAR)**:
   - Measures the percentage of agents who met or exceeded their sales targets.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{TAR} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of Agents Who Met Targets}}{\text{Total Number of Agents}} \right) \times 100\%
     \]

2. **Average Profit per Agent (APA)**:
   - The average profit generated by each agent, excluding rewards.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{APA} = \frac{\text{Total Profit}}{\text{Total Number of Agents}}
     \]

3. **Reward Utilization Efficiency (RUE)**:
   - Compares the total rewards given to the profits generated by agents.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{RUE} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Rewards Given}}{\text{Total Profit}} \right) \times 100\%
     \]

4. **Return on Investment (ROI)**:
   - Calculates the net profit or loss as a percentage of the rewards spent.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{ROI} = \left( \frac{\text{Total Profit} - \text{Total Rewards}}{\text{Total Rewards}} \right) \times 100\%
     \]

5. **Sales Performance (SP)**:
   - Measures the average number of products sold per agent.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{SP} = \frac{\text{Total Number of Products Sold}}{\text{Total Number of Agents}}
     \]

6. **Cost per Unit Sold (CUS)**:
   - Shows the average reward cost per product sold.
   - **Formula**:
     \[
     \text{CUS} = \frac{\text{Total Rewards Given}}{\text{Total Number of Products Sold}}
     \]

## Results

### Group A

- **Target Achievement Rate (TAR)**: 5.21%
- **Average Profit per Agent (APA)**: \$14,719.98
- **Reward Utilization Efficiency (RUE)**: 249.09%
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: -59.85%
- **Sales Performance (SP)**: 1.61 products per agent
- **Cost per Unit Sold (CUS)**: \$22,819.76

**Interpretation**:

- Only 5.21% of agents met their sales targets, indicating low effectiveness of the incentive.
- Rewards given were high relative to the profits generated, leading to a negative ROI.
- The cost per unit sold was significantly high, making the campaign inefficient.
- No significant difference compared to the control group, suggesting that the incentive did not substantially impact performance.

### Group B

- **Target Achievement Rate (TAR)**: 20.58%
- **Average Profit per Agent (APA)**: \$30,433.47
- **Reward Utilization Efficiency (RUE)**: 142.98%
- **Return on Investment (ROI)**: -30.06%
- **Sales Performance (SP)**: 4.59 products per agent
- **Cost per Unit Sold (CUS)**: \$9,483.46

**Interpretation**:

- A higher percentage of agents achieved their targets compared to Group A.
- Average profit per agent was more than double that of Group A and the control group.
- While ROI was still negative, it was better than Group A, indicating improved efficiency.
- Statistically significant performance improvement over the control group, demonstrating the incentive's effectiveness.

### Group C (Control Group)

- **Average Profit per Agent (APA)**: \$13,847.70
- **Sales Performance (SP)**: 1.05 products per agent

**Interpretation**:

- Agents generated profits without any incentives, serving as a baseline for comparison.
- Sales performance was lower than both Group A and B.
- No reward costs were incurred, resulting in higher profit retention per dollar earned.

## Conclusion

- **Group A**: The incentive structure was ineffective. Low target achievement and high reward costs led to a negative ROI, with no significant performance improvement over the control group.
- **Group B**: The incentive program was more successful. Higher sales and profits per agent, along with a significant difference from the control group, indicate that the incentive positively impacted performance. However, ROI was still negative, suggesting a need for further optimization.
- **Group C**: While profitability per agent was maintained without additional costs, sales performance was lower. Relying solely on this approach may not drive the desired increase in sales volume.

## Recommendations

1. **Reassess Incentive Structures**:
   - **Group A**: Modify the targets and rewards to better motivate agents without incurring excessive costs.
   - **Group B**: Fine-tune the reward system to improve ROI, possibly by adjusting reward amounts or introducing tiered incentives for surpassing targets.

2. **Optimize Reward Utilization**:
   - Implement a sliding scale for rewards to encourage agents to exceed targets, potentially improving profitability and ROI.
   - Ensure that reward costs are proportionate to the profits generated.

3. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Continuously track KPIs to identify areas for improvement.
   - Be prepared to make real-time adjustments to the campaign based on performance data.

4. **Consider Agent Feedback**:
   - Gather feedback from agents to understand challenges and motivational factors.
   - Use insights to tailor incentive programs that effectively drive performance.

## Key Learnings

- **Effective Incentives Drive Performance**: Well-designed incentive programs can significantly enhance sales performance.
- **Cost Efficiency is Crucial**: Balancing reward costs with profits is essential to ensure campaigns are financially viable.
- **Data-Driven Approach**: Defining clear KPIs enables objective evaluation and informed decision-making.
- **Adaptability**: Being willing to adjust strategies based on data and feedback leads to more successful outcomes.
